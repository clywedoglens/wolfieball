Row Row Row Your Boat:

I used three different audio tracks for the different waveforms: sin waves, square waves, and sawtooth.
I modelled the song based on what the song would sound like in a C-Major scale, starting with C4. 
The made every single "beat" a certain pitch and spaced them out with silence, typically around .4 seconds. 

The order of pitches are: 
C4 C4 C4 D4 E4 E4 D4 E4 F4 G4 (Each beat here is about .8 seconds, with the last one being 1.2 seconds)
C5 C5 C5 G4 G4 G4 E4 E4 E4 C4 C4 C4 (Each beat here lasts .4 seconds, with silence of about .1 seconds in between)
G4 F4 E4 D4 C4 (I spaced the beats out more for more of a "finishing" effect, beats lasted .2 seconds with gaps being .6 seconds. The last beat was 
slightly longer at .4 seconds)
